# Enyimba AI
The project involves a series of Python scripts that work together to create an advanced AI chatbot using the LLaMA large language model and AlphaZero self-play concepts applied to language model strategies (LLMs) with prompt engineering. Below is a detailed README description that outlines the functionality and purpose of each script in the context of the project:

# AlphaZero-Inspired Chatbot with LLaMA and Prompt Engineering

## Overview
This project aims to build a powerful AI chatbot leveraging the LLaMA large language model (LLM) and incorporating strategies inspired by the AlphaZero self-play algorithm. The core idea is to use prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating responses, evaluating actions, and refining strategies, akin to how AlphaZero improves its gameplay.

## Components
The system consists of several Python scripts, each handling a specific aspect of the chatbot's operation:

### 1. `hidden_strategy.py`
- **Purpose**: Establishes an initial strategy for the chatbot, setting the groundwork for how it approaches tasks.
- **Functionality**: Determines the chatbot's 'hidden state' strategy by assessing tasks and formulating an approach based on its training and knowledge.

### 2. `language_tree_search.py`
- **Purpose**: Emulates AlphaZero's tree search methodology for exploring potential actions and decisions.
- **Functionality**: Creates a vast tree of possible actions or decisions, each branch representing a different approach or solution. It analyzes the frequency of use, effectiveness, and predicted outcomes for each branch.

### 3. `policy.py`
- **Purpose**: Decides the best course of action (policy) for given tasks.
- **Functionality**: Evaluates the potential actions identified in `language_tree_search.py`, selecting the most optimal move based on current information.

### 4. `reward.py`
- **Purpose**: Assesses the effectiveness of actions taken by the chatbot.
- **Functionality**: Reflects on the chatbot's previous actions, learning from feedback to fine-tune future strategies. It evaluates the 'reward' from past actions, a key concept in reinforcement learning.

### 5. `updated_strategy.py`
- **Purpose**: Updates the chatbot's strategy based on new information and experiences.
- **Functionality**: Continuously refines the chatbot's approach, recalculating strategies in light of new data and feedback.

### 6. `value.py`
- **Purpose**: Assesses the value of the current situation or state.
- **Functionality**: Gauges the relevance, importance, or accuracy of information in the current context, helping the chatbot evaluate its standing.

## Methodology
The chatbot uses a blend of AlphaZero's self-play strategies and advanced prompt engineering with LLaMA. It mimics the process of observing, strategizing, evaluating actions, and refining approaches. The bot undergoes a continuous cycle of generating responses, assessing their effectiveness, and updating its strategies accordingly.

## Goals
- To create a highly adaptive AI chatbot capable of handling a variety of tasks.
- To leverage the strengths of the LLaMA model in generating responses and solving problems.
- To utilize self-play and reinforcement learning concepts for continuous improvement.

## Usage
- Each script is designed to function as part of a larger system. They should be used in conjunction with a Django application that provides user queries and facilitates the chatbot's interaction.
- The scripts are designed to be modular, allowing for flexibility and customization based on specific needs.

## Future Directions
- Enhancements in prompt engineering to improve response quality.
- Further integration of AlphaZero strategies for decision-making.
- Expansion of the system to handle more complex and diverse tasks.
