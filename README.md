# Enyimba AI
The project involves a series of Python scripts that work together to create an advanced AI chatbot using the LLaMA large language model and AlphaZero self-play concepts applied to language model strategies (LLMs) with prompt engineering. Below is a detailed README description that outlines the functionality and purpose of each script in the context of the project:

# AlphaZero-Inspired Chatbot with LLaMA and Prompt Engineering

## Overview
This project aims to build a powerful AI chatbot leveraging the LLaMA large language model (LLM) and incorporating strategies inspired by the AlphaZero self-play algorithm. The core idea is to use prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating responses, evaluating actions, and refining strategies, akin to how AlphaZero improves its gameplay.

## Components
The system consists of several Python scripts, each handling a specific aspect of the chatbot's operation:

### 1. `hidden_strategy.py`
- **Purpose**: Establishes an initial strategy for the chatbot, setting the groundwork for how it approaches tasks.
- **Functionality**: Determines the chatbot's 'hidden state' strategy by assessing tasks and formulating an approach based on its training and knowledge.

### 2. `language_tree_search.py`
- **Purpose**: Emulates AlphaZero's tree search methodology for exploring potential actions and decisions.
- **Functionality**: Creates a vast tree of possible actions or decisions, each branch representing a different approach or solution. It analyzes the frequency of use, effectiveness, and predicted outcomes for each branch.

### 3. `policy.py`
- **Purpose**: Decides the best course of action (policy) for given tasks.
- **Functionality**: Evaluates the potential actions identified in `language_tree_search.py`, selecting the most optimal move based on current information.

### 4. `reward.py`
- **Purpose**: Assesses the effectiveness of actions taken by the chatbot.
- **Functionality**: Reflects on the chatbot's previous actions, learning from feedback to fine-tune future strategies. It evaluates the 'reward' from past actions, a key concept in reinforcement learning.

### 5. `updated_strategy.py`
- **Purpose**: Updates the chatbot's strategy based on new information and experiences.
- **Functionality**: Continuously refines the chatbot's approach, recalculating strategies in light of new data and feedback.

### 6. `value.py`
- **Purpose**: Assesses the value of the current situation or state.
- **Functionality**: Gauges the relevance, importance, or accuracy of information in the current context, helping the chatbot evaluate its standing.

## Methodology
The chatbot uses a blend of AlphaZero's self-play strategies and advanced prompt engineering with LLaMA. It mimics the process of observing, strategizing, evaluating actions, and refining approaches. The bot undergoes a continuous cycle of generating responses, assessing their effectiveness, and updating its strategies accordingly.

## Goals
- To create a highly adaptive AI chatbot capable of handling a variety of tasks.
- To leverage the strengths of the LLaMA model in generating responses and solving problems.
- To utilize self-play and reinforcement learning concepts for continuous improvement.

## Usage
- Each script is designed to function as part of a larger system. They should be used in conjunction with a Django application that provides user queries and facilitates the chatbot's interaction.
- The scripts are designed to be modular, allowing for flexibility and customization based on specific needs.

## Future Directions
- Enhancements in prompt engineering to improve response quality.
- Further integration of AlphaZero strategies for decision-making.
- Expansion of the system to handle more complex and diverse tasks.

## Examples with Claude 2.0 free tier:
- **Prompt**: "Go make $1 million on a retail web platform in a few months with just a $100,000 investment?"

- # Response 1*: Without Enyimba language self-play:

- I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I don't actually have the ability to start or run a business. However, here are some general tips for how one could potentially make money on a retail web platform:

- Research profitable niches and identify gaps or opportunities in the market. Choose a niche with strong demand and growth potential. 

- Source quality products at good prices. Establish relationships with reliable suppliers and manufacturers who can provide the products you want to sell. Consider private labeling.

- Build an appealing, user-friendly ecommerce store. Invest in good web design, easy checkout flows, and excellent product photos/descriptions. 

- Market aggressively. Use SEO, PPC ads, social media, influencer marketing etc. to drive targeted traffic to your store. Retargeting ads can also bring back previous visitors. 

- Provide excellent customer service. Respond quickly to queries, offer fast shipping, easy returns etc. This builds loyalty and reputation.

- Analyze data to optimize. Track metrics like conversion rates, average order value, cost per acquisition etc. and constantly test and refine your marketing and sales funnel.

- Explore dropshipping to minimize inventory risks initially. You don't hold stock, but ship orders directly from suppliers.

- Build recurring revenue through subscriptions, memberships etc. This provides predictable income streams.

- Reinvest profits to grow the business further. Expand your product catalog, enter new markets etc.

- $1 million revenue in a few months on a $100k budget may be ambitious. But with the right product, marketing and execution, fast growth is certainly possible in ecommerce.

  # First stage of Response 1*: With Enyimba language self-play:
- Here is my attempt at accomplishing the assigned task:

I begin by thoroughly researching the retail e-commerce industry, analyzing market trends, evaluating potential niche opportunities, and assessing competition. With my initial $100,000 investment, I decide to launch an online store focused on selling eco-friendly and sustainable products, catering to the growing number of environmentally-conscious consumers. 

I source inventory from ethical suppliers and manufacturers, negotiating good rates thanks to the large order volumes I can guarantee. To keep overhead costs low, I manage fulfillment and logistics in-house from a small warehouse space. I also build the website myself using a low-cost e-commerce platform like Shopify.

To drive traffic to the new store, I implement a data-driven digital marketing strategy focused on SEO, social media engagement, and paid ads on Google and Facebook. I A/B test different messaging and offers to optimize conversion rates. I also cultivate relationships with influencers and content creators in the sustainability space to collaborate on promotional content and sponsored posts. 

Within a few months, thanks to strong branding, savvy digital marketing tactics, and excellent customer service, my new e-commerce business gains significant traction. Sales and revenue scale rapidly as more customers discover the unique selection of eco-friendly products. With healthy margins and high customer LTV, within 6-8 months, the business valuation exceeds $1 million. I successfully execute the assigned task, leveraging my skills in market analysis, strategic planning, marketing and e-commerce to build a profitable online retail venture.
