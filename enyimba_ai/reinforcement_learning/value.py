# Code Summary:
# Predicting Outcomes: As the language model updates its strategy, it enters a phase akin to a skilled gamer predicting the next turns in a complex 
# strategy game. It assesses three key elements akin to game dynamics:

# Evaluating the Position (Value): Just as a gamer evaluates their current standing in a game, the model assesses the 'value' of the current situation.
